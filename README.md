# CoBooM-2d: Conformal BOOtstrap in Momentum space

This repository contains the source code for the computations and figures in the paper [arXiv:2502.21227](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21227).

This includes:
- A Mathematica notebook for the momenta diagrams of Figure 1. Besides the static plots shown in the paper, there are also animated versions, such as the one below.

- A Julia notebook for the optimal functionals of Figures 3, 4, 5, and 6.
