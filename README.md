# The Conformal Bootstrap in Momentum space (CoBooM-2d)

This repository contains the source code for the computations and figures in the paper [arXiv:2502.21227](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21227).

This includes:
- A Mathematica notebook for the momenta diagrams of Figure 1. Besides the static plots shown in the paper, there are also animated versions, such as the one below.

- Another Mathematica notebook for algebraic computations involving the momentum-space conformal blocks, and convergence tests such as the one given in Figure 2.

- A Julia notebook for the optimal functionals of Figures 3, 4, 5, and 6.

- A Mathematica notebook for computations of OPE coefficients in the vacuum module using the Virasoro algebra.

*Note:* the OPE coefficients given in Table 1 are taken from another repository of mine: [QuasiPrimaryData](https://github.com/gillioz/QuasiPrimaryData/).
